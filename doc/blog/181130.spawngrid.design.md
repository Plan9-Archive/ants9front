## Design of the ANTS colony-spawngrid

This post describes work-in-progress. If you are interested in the current status, stop in to gridchat on the 9gridchan public grid.

### Overview

ANTS colony servers provide spawning and saving of snapshotted Plan 9 namespace environments on demand, from a globally replicated store of filesystem images. The goal is a simple Plan 9 analog of "cloud computing" platforms such as AWS and Google Compute Engine. The modern distributed architecture of containerized microservices is related to what Plan 9 pioneered in the 1990s - per process independent namespace (the foundation of container-like systems), and single purpose network services (delivered via 9p in Plan 9 as opposted to http-json) working together.

Plan 9 laid a technological and conceptual foundation for this approach to distributed systems, but in its own network architecture and administration, it mostly remained rooted in static pre-configuration, and single-point-of-failure services. The flexibility of per-process namespace was not generally used to create container-like systems. The ants project is based on the belief that container-like partitions of the namespace represent a natural evolutionary flow from Plan 9 design principles. No attempt has been made to imitate particular features of BSD jails or linux cgroups, but rather feature development based on the experience of using Plan 9 systems in this way.

### Functionality

Once a user has been given an account on the system, they run a program called 'gridorc' targeting a server of their choice, probably whichever is located closest to them:

	gridorc -u username -h server

Once connected, the user may enter

	scores

to see a list of filesystem snapshots available for spawning. To make an environment available for rcpu access, the user enters

	spawn scorename

which triggers the creation of a fossil file server serving a copy of the filesystem referred to by that name, the creation of a standard plan9 namespace environment rooted in that snapshot, and the provision of a cpu listener to allow access. The user can rcpu in to what behaves as a full self-sufficient plan9 environment. At any point, the user may

	save oldname newname

to create a new snapshot of the current state of the disk fileystem. Once a named snapshot is created, that particular name is immutable - you always get the same fs state when it is spawned. The save command must always be issued to preserve changes in state, which will always create a new immutable snapshot name. The data for this snapshot will be replicated to all other colony storage servers along with the name information.

Snapshots are private to users by default. A user may allow another user to spawn a copy of the current state of their fs with the command

	invite username scorename 

which will add a user to the filesystem, place them in the sys group, and then save a snapshot. To free the resources associated with a spawned environment, the command

	boom scorename

is issued. The final command available,

	status

lists the namespace environments owned by the user currently being served by the storage-cpu pair.

### Storage backend

The backing store of the grid has two components - a set of venti datablocks, and a database file in ndb format mapping rootscores,names for those rootscores, and users. By replicating this data between storage nodes, the grid services can spawn any root filesystem on any server on demand. Synchronization of venti blocks is performed by the ventiprog command. Each server stores in 9fat a server.info file for each other venti it wishes to replicate blocks, and then runs ventiprog -f server.info periodically for each of the .info files. This is efficient because only newly written blocks will be replicated.

The scores database is also stored in 9fat in the 'scorenames' file. A simple script, scorecopy, is used to sync this file between servers. Storage servers provide a /srv/fatsrv of their 9fat to make this more convenient. The scorecopy replication should match the ventiprog replication - each venti should have a matching set of blocks and corresponding scores.
