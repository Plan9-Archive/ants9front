services needed:

spawnroot(scorename, listenport)
	generate fsname and fsconsname from the scorename?
	where do we put the /srv files?

fetchroot(dialstring, startscript, listenport)
	should automate the fact that listenport from spawnroot and dialstring here should match

/* actually we should probably package spawnroot and fetchroot together at top level ui? */
/* but make it still possible to separate because you often want multiple userspace on one root */

savesnap [optional name]
	update the rootscore of current name or provide a new name

cleanup
	free resources of the current environment
