temporary state files

/tmp/killscript.$name on storage made by namefossil+spawnroot, invoked from cpu side boom service
/tmp/stononce on storage server for unique names for scores. used by storagesvc save
/tmp/spawncount on storage server for limiting number of spawned roots, storagesvc
/tmp/nextport on storage server for next port number to serve on, storagesvc
/tmp/nextport on cpu server for next port number to serve on, cpusvc

srvs

/srv/gridsvc on storage, main control hubfs, storagesvc on sto and cpusvc on cpu attach to it, client mounts it at /n/g for gridorc to talk to
/srv/rootname, /srv/rootnamefossil, /srv/rootnamefscons  on storage, spawmed for each root
/zrv/rootname control hub for fetching a root, create by cpusvc and the interior rc is rfork V and newns in the new /srv/boot
/srv/boot etc in private /srv ns - spawned on cpu by fetchroot, this ns is cpud in by clients

services

aux/listen1 -v tcp!*!16999 /bin/tlssrv -a /bin/userreq #storage server command/id validation service

server% aux/listen1 -tv tcp!*!17034 tlssrv -A /bin/aux/trampoline /net.alt/tcp!127.1!17034 #storage server auth'd venti service
client% aux/listen1 -tv tcp!127.1!27034 /bin/tlsclient -a tcp!eusto1!17034 #how a client makes a local port for remote auth'd venti

- the above setup may be repeated bidirectionally, so both servers can dump blocks to each other 6

permanent state files

9fat/scorenames - rootscores available across the replicated ventis
9fat/sto1.info sto2.info etc - info files for ventiprog tracking block duplication progress. seeded with an initial line setting venti env var to target.

logs

/tmp/stolog on storage
/tmp/sysaddlog on storage
/tmp/invitelog on storage
/tmp/cpusvclog on cpu
