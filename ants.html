<h1><center>Advanced Namespace Tools for Plan 9</center></h1>
<p>
Plan 9 ANTS is a collection of software for making Plan 9 systems more
flexible and capable by leveraging the power of namespaces.
<p>
The main component is a modified kernel which needs no root fs at
boot.  It creates an always available ram/paq rooted namespace
accessible by cpu(1) from which the user may launch conventional
namespaces.  The kernel patches also allow rewriting of process
namespace via the ns file in /proc and multiple independent /srv
spaces.  Additional tools allow the user to reroot quickly to
different namespaces and create hubs of persistent rc shells shared
between all machines on a grid.
<p>
ANTS is compatible with existing x86 Plan 9 installations.  The ANTS
kernel and tools modify startup and create new capabilities, but do
not change the standard user environment.  You can install the ANTS
kernel and tools directly to a fresh install from the 9front .iso, by
adding the 9ants kernel and optional tools.tgz to your 9fat partition
and editing plan9.ini as needed.
<p>
ANTS is a modular toolkit.  Many of the namespace modifying scripts,
the hubfs shell multiplexer, and the rio variant "grio", do not depend
on the kernel modifications.  The kernel modifications for bootup and
for writable /proc/*/ns are independent from each other.
